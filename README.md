## 1. INTRODUCTION

The website I have created is about myself and my journey as an Electrical Engineer. It is an insight into what I do and how I got to where I am
in my working career so far. The website also includes links to previous and current employers.

The main reason I made this website is to outline the field of work I am in and also to add future projects to my portfolio as I continue to improve and build on my skills of different coding languages and shape my future as a Front End Developer.

## 2. UX

I have purposely developed my website to be easily accessible through navigation tools. Throughout each page I have included clickable web-links to external sites which are relatable to the page including social media links and web-page links to previous companies I have worked for which will provide further information for the user.

The reason I have chose these colors for my website are both that they look good and also are primarily based on the work uniform we wear at Elect Automation. I believe all colors used compliment each other well.

I have used imagery in my project for two main reasons:

* It provides the user with a clearer idea of what our work entails and the functuality of the machines we produce.

* The imagery also helps to provide the user with an image timeline of my working career so far as they scroll through the website.

## 3. WIREFRAMES

As before any project, there was quite a bit of planning that had to be done before anything was started. I had to decide on the page layout and the functionality of the webpage before any code was written. I used Balsamiq in order to do this. This allows my to easily sketch out frames of each page and how I wanted them to be perceived by the user.

Although not all the wireframes I created were what the final project looked like, I found this process saved me time and also give my a clearer view on what direction I wanted to take with my project.

## 4. WEBSITE FEATURES

### Home Page

The navbar I have used throughout my website is quite simplistic which provides a four page menu bar that allows the user to navigate thorugh the website easily. This navbar menu is made responsive to whatever size of screen the user is using so on smaller screens it will collapse into a hamburger button. I have also designed my own logo which is visible in every page as well as a smaller screen.

In the home page I have just included a small introduction as to give the user a brief insight into myself and what they will find in this
website. This indroduction is also accompanied by a profile picture of myself which is also responsive to different device screens.

At the bottom of each page are three sections which include all the information the user might need to know in order to contact me or view my online profiles. These include my phone number, email address and the links to my Facebook, LinkedIn and Github pprofiles. The middle section includes a 'Download CV' which will allow the user to view my CV which I have also updated for this project.

### About Me

I have included quite a lot of information about myself in my 'About Me' page. I wanted to give the user as much detail as I possibly could about my work. I have approached this page as more of an article based piece, starting from when I first left school and started work to where I am now. This page also provides images of machines and control panels we have worked on which I feel will give the user a better understanding of the work I am involved in.

Throughout this page is a number of clickable links to different websites related to myself. They include companies I have worked for in the past as well as where I studied my electrical course. I have highlighted this links by changing the color of the text as well as the hover function.
