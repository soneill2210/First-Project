## 1. INTRODUCTION

The website I have created is about myself and my journey as an Electrical Engineer. It is an insight into what I do and how I got to where I am
in my working career so far. The website also includes links to previous and current employers.

The main reason I made this website is to outline the field of work I am in and also to add future projects to my portfolio as I continue to improve and build on my skills of different coding languages and shape my future as a Front End Developer.
