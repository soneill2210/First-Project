## 1. INTRODUCTION

The website I have created is about myself and my journey as an Electrical Engineer. It is an insight into what I do and how I got to where I am
in my working career so far. The website also includes links to previous and current employers.

The main reason I made this website is to outline the field of work I am in and also to add future projects to my portfolio as I continue to improve and build on my skills of different coding languages and shape my future as a Front End Developer.

## 2. UX

I have purposely developed my website to be easily accessible through navigation tools. Throughout each page I have included clickable web-links to external sites which are relatable to the page including social media links and web-page links to previous companies I have worked for which will provide further information for the user.

The reason I have chose these colors for my website are both that they look good and also are primarily based on the work uniform we wear at Elect Automation. I believe all colors used compliment each other well.

I have used imagery in my project for two main reasons:

* It provides the user with a clearer idea of what our work entails and the functuality of the machines we produce.

* The imagery also helps to provide the user with an image timeline of my working career so far as they scroll through the website.

## 3. WIREFRAMES

As before any project, there was quite a bit of planning that had to be done before anything was started. I had to decide on the page layout and the functionality of the webpage before any code was written. I used Balsamiq in order to do this. This allows me to easily sketch out frames of each page and how I wanted them to be perceived by the user.

Although not all the wireframes I created were what the final project looked like, I found this process saved me time and also give my a clearer view on what direction I wanted to take with my project.

## 4. WEBSITE FEATURES

### Home Page

The navbar I have used throughout my website is quite simplistic which provides a four page menu bar that allows the user to navigate thorugh the website easily. This navbar menu is made responsive to whatever size of screen the user is using so on smaller screens it will collapse into a hamburger button. I have also designed my own logo which is visible in every page as well as a smaller screen.

In the home page I have just included a small introduction as to give the user a brief insight into myself and what they will find in this
website. This indroduction is also accompanied by a profile picture of myself which is also responsive to different device screens.

At the bottom of each page are three sections which include all the information the user might need to know in order to contact me or view my online profiles. These include my phone number, email address and the links to my Facebook, LinkedIn and Github pprofiles. The middle section includes a 'Download CV' which will allow the user to view my CV which I have also updated for this project.

### About Me

I have included quite a lot of information about myself in my 'About Me' page. I wanted to give the user as much detail as I possibly could about my work. I have approached this page as more of an article based piece, starting from when I first left school and started work to where I am now. This page also provides images of machines and control panels we have worked on which I feel will give the user a better understanding of the work I am involved in.

Throughout this page is a number of clickable links to different websites related to myself. They include companies I have worked for in the past as well as where I studied my electrical course. I have highlighted this links by changing the color of the text as well as the hover function.

At the bottom of this page are two sections which include my employment history as well as my education. In the first section of the employment history I have inserted the three logos of my previous employers which are also a clickable link. These logos will increase in size and conatain a border around them when the user hovers over them. Under these logos is my role at each company and the time spent there.

At the bottom of every page is a footer with a copyright icon and my name.

### Portfolio

This webpage begins with a brief introduction as to what the purpose of the porfolio page is. I have also created six sections in which I will include a direct link to future projects I have worked on. I hope to fill this page quite quickly in order to build on my skills and different projects.

### Contact Me

In this page is a simple contact form which the user can use to get in touch with me through email. Once the message or enquiry is submitted it is directed to my own personal email inbox in which it can be replied to.

## 5. FUTURE FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE

As this project is solely based on HTML and CSS, I have used no other languages throughout. When I start to learn Javascript, I plan to implement so javascript functions into this project. Two of the main things I would like to include in the future are:

**Audio and visual controls** - I hope to add a short video of one of these Jaw Crushers in operation to show how each of the machines we manufacture are specified for different duties and environments.

**Submit** - I also would like to add a 'Thank You' response to the 'Submit' button when the user fills out the contact form in the 'Contact Me' page of the website.

## 6. TECHNOLOGIES USED

In order to create this website I have used a number of different platforms and technologies in order to carry out different functions. They are as follows:

**Balsamiq** I used Balsamiq in order to carry out and implement a plan for the layout of my project.

**HTML5** I used HTML5 to create the content of this website.

**CSS** I used CSS for the design and to custom style the elements on my webpage.

**Bootstrap v5.0** I used Bootstrap in order to create a responsive grid system so the website will be responsive on all devices.

**Google Fonts** I have used Google fonts in order to create a style font for my project.

**Visual Studio Code** I have used Visual Studio Code as the platform for writing my code for my project.

**Github** I used Github to create a repository for my project where I can store all my committed changes.

## TESTING OF RESPONSIVNESS

I used the Google development tool to constantly check each change that I made to my webpage against the different screen sizes provided, from mobile devices to ipad and desktop, to see if functions of the website was working as I intended.

## PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED

There were a few issues that I encountered while working on this project which I had to resolve.

### Placement of images

I found with the placement of a few images I have used an issue especially when it came to loading the website onto a smaller screen but eventually got it resolved with a few positioning styles.

### Sizing

At the beginning I found that the sizing of different sections in my website wasn't working to the desired effect. Although frustrating at times, it was practising more with the functionality of Bootstrap which helped this issue.

## DEPLOYMENT TO GITHUB

In order to deploy my project to Github I followed the following steps:

1. Opened up Visual Studio Code and used the 'Get Bootstrap' webpage to copy over the base for the project which included Bootstrp itself as well as the appropriate meta tags etc.

2. After I inserted this into my VS Code, I saved it and used the 'Account' settings to link my project to the disired respository which I had opened in Github call 'First-project'.

3. After linking this to my repository, I then used the 'Source Control' option to initiate my first commit. I named this 'init commit'.

4. From that point on throughout working on my project I would commit to Github often in order to keep my most recent changed stored in my repository.

### Github repository link

### Running Code Locally

To run my code locally, users can download a local copy of my code to their desktop by completing the following steps:

1. Got to my Github repository.

2. Click on 'Clone or Download'.

3. Click on 'Download ZIP'.

4. Once downloaded, extract the zip files contents and run my website locally.
